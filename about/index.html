<p>Born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham" rel="nofollow">Birmingham, UK</a>. I've been building web applications for over
ten years. I love all things open source and code wise Ruby is my language of choice, vim my editor.</p>

<p>I have a degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://www.aber.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Aberystwyth university</a>.
I worked as a PHP developer before becoming a Ruby on Rails developer.
I am currently IT manager for one of the UK's online printer ink retailers, <a href="http://www.stinkyinkshop.co.uk">Stinkyink.com</a>.

<p>When I'm not hacking on code I will most likely be out shredding mountain bike trials with my fantastic mates, or out enjoying a meal. I'm also known to enjoy computer games from time-to-time.</p>
