I did so well last year keeping up with posting on the blog, but I've lapsed once again. Life has gotten in the way again. Work has been busy and we've been busy looking after our little one. I can't belive he's one in a few months. I know people say, but it really does fly by.

I'm looking to get a few more articles written up, but I've been doing less technical things outside of work and I've found the love for riding my bike again. I've been doing that with any spare time I have. I would like to find a way to incoporate that into the main web, without splintering the site into many different topics. I'll have a think, but for now, enjoy some MTB videos I've started making.
