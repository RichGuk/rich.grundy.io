For years now, I've been trying to think of a way to include personal random notes, links or images into my website without detracting from the main articles I write—a sort of individual Twitter stream, away from corporate control. A place where I own the data.

I never bothered because it seemed like a lot of effort to maintain with a static generated site, and I was never too sure how to meld the blend. That is until I came across [Max Böck's](https://mxb.dev/blog/indieweb-link-sharing/) blog the other week while searching for 11ty Asset Pipeline stuff. He used serverless functions and a SPA to share content easily to a notes section (relying on Netlify's auto build). Perfect! His work set me on a path to create my own version; thus, "Ramblings" was born!

I will detail in future posts the tech that powers it. I went a bit OTT.

I write more in-depth articles about programming and technology on my main [Writings](/blog/) page. But for now, my first Ramble is over!
