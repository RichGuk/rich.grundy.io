title: Network audio player with Raspberry Pi & HifiBerry
---

Recently I was after a network audio player for the bedroom that didn't cost
a lot of money and could handle FLAC. I already had a pair of small [powered
speakers][a2 speakers] and was really after just a WiFi [DAC] - something the
[Pi] sounded ideal for.
