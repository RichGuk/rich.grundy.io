title: "My new office - with an Ikea desk hack!"
---

This weekend I finished my new office. It's taken a few days of planning and a
weekend of Ikea/DIY, but I'm very pleased with the results.

Below is my old office for reference; it was functional, but wasn't what I
really wanted, more something I quickly put together.

## Remove all things

The first step for me, even before planning was to strip the room bare and
repaint the walls.

## Planning

I had rough ideas in my head of how I wanted to the office to look. I had spent
a few nights sitting in the room thinking, and re-thinking; browsing
[/r/battlestations][battlestations] and [r/malelivingspace][malelivingspace] for
ideas until I was finally ready.

I had initially planned to use something like [sketchup] to design my room,
however I couldn't be bothered with the learning curve. I decided to dive
straight into the DIY step.

## Buy things

I really love wooden furniture, so I had to get a solid wood desk. I hunted
around online and locally and for the size of desk I was after, and the best
option was an Ikea kitchen unit top. I went with the [HAMMARP] oak worktop,
which is around £100-£120.

I bought some [ALEX drawers][ALEX] (£60) to use as support for the desk and
storage, and some [CAPITA] brackets (£10), which, with the off cut from the
desk, had originally been planned for use to raise the monitor, but were later
repurposed as speaker stands.

I was also after a Pixar style lamp, but didn't want to spend silly amounts of
money. The Ikea £8 [TERTIAL] lamp seemed ideal.

## Fitting

The fitting of the actual desk was simple, the drawers were taking
most of the weight and the wall needed minimal battens for support. I was taking
off around 40cm from the desk, and decided to use the off cut for making speaker
stands.

An important initial step was placing the monitors and working out where the
cable holes needed to be.

I then treated the desk with some wood oil.

Finally fixed the desk to the wall, placed the speaker stands and drilled the
desk securely to the drawers.
