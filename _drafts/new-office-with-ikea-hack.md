title: "My new office - with an Ikea desk hack!"
---

This weekend I finished my new office, and I'm very pleased with the results.
It's taken a few days of planning and a weekend of Ikea and DIY. _Pro tip: don't
go to Ikea at the weekend._

Below is my old office for reference. It functioned fine, but wasn't what I
really wanted and more something I quickly put together when I moved in from the
previous owner's left-behinds.

I didn't really take any step-by-step pictures of the office build, but I'll
attempt to run through my process regardless.

## Step 1. Remove all things

The first step for me, even before planning was to strip the room bare and
repaint the walls.

## Step 2. Planning

I had rough ideas in my head of how I wanted to the office to look. I had spent
a few nights sitting in the room thinking, and re-thinking; browsing
[/r/battlestations][battlestations] and [r/malelivingspace][malelivingspace] for
ideas until I was finally ready.

I had initially planned to use something like [sketchup] to design my room,
however I couldn't be bothered with the learning curve. I decided to dive
straight into the DIY step.

## Step 3. Buy things

I wanted a wood top for my desk, but needed a fairly lengthy desk. After looking
around online, and at local DIY stores, Ikea kitchen units seemed like the best
option. They were fairly priced for soil wood and came in sizes I could work
with. I went with the [HAMMARP] oak worktop, which is around £100-£120.

I also bought some [ALEX drawers][ALEX], mainly for adding support to the desk
but also doubles up as file storage.
