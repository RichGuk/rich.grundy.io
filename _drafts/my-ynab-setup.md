title: "My YNAB setup"

[YNAB][YNAB] (You Need a Budget) is software designed to help you better
manage your finances. It got recommended to me a while back by a friend, and
since then I've been fine tuning my YNAB workflow to something that suits me.
This post details my workflow. Feel free to take from it what you need, to help
you fine tune your workflow.
