title: "Rails and AngularJS: keep it simple"

A few months ago I started experimenting with [AngularJS][angularjs] and was
blown away by it's power. I went full-steam into an admin interface rewrite
with a totally angular mindset and it felt great! I had a solid API, templates,
routes, controllers, service objects and directives.
