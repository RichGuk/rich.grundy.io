title: "Rails and AngularJS: keep it simple"
---

A few months ago I started experimenting with [AngularJS] and was
blown away by its power. I had planned an entire admin rewrite with
it. I had a solid API,
templates, routes, controllers, directives and service objects. I was in an
angular paradise, but for how long?

During the process I began to feel I had gone too far. I was unsure if AngularJS
was the right choice; it felt like I was duplicating much of what Rails already
gave you, and I started to lose faith. I found the documentation lacking, and
there seemed to be no pre-defined structure to the code. I felt overwhelmed.
However, I was not alone in feeling this way, and found several posts of similar
experiences: [Ben Nadel] and [Localytics]. After some reflection, and a short
break from the project, I decided to take a step back.  It was time to ease off
on angular and let Rails take care of the things it does really well.

## Code structure

## Keep routing in Rails

## Use ERB templates

## Use Rails for heavy lifting
